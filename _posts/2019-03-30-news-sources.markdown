**Disclaimer**

Everything mentioned in the following post is a direct translation of my thoughts that are derived by observing people around me.
Everything mentioned is anecdotal. Writing style is going to be informal and it might be a grammatical hellhole. 
Oh also, maybe would have a PG-13 words. (As is evident)
```

Very, Very briefly articulating the idea here.

**Problem I want to tackle**

In today's time, where WhatsApp is a source of "news" that anybody can manufacture, every woke millenial and an asleep boomer is both being a part of an echo chamber. There are two sides of a coin, but people are going to focus on the side they like a lot. A scary future is where you'd see propaganda content creating source as "news centers". While I am optimistic that this is not the present, there is enough data to prove otherwise. :)


**What is the idea?**

The idea is to create a platform (API/App/Bot/All of the above) that curates news, strips the source and asks the reader to vote on how informative the article was. One of simpler measure I am thinking of is bias. The platform must allow users to vote on if an article is biased or not. Since the source, author and other identifying details are stripped out, I am assuming the focus will be on the content. 

Fraud detection can be done with predictive analytics. We would be able to detect the time spent on reading an article v/s voting, voting trends, etc to classify if a person is in an echo chamber or is nuetral. 


**Goals**

1. Make people read the other side.
2. Curate bias of a source based on the content and not the source, author, etc.
3. Fact Check every piece of news that a person reads.

I will be using this post to update progress on this.
Here is what I am planning:

1. API to collect news from multiple sources
2. Strip the collected sources, NLP to synonimize certain words in the content to anonymize the source.
3. Content Pushing Medium (API -> Bot -> App)

Will probably update with a nice PPT and UI Designs later ;)
