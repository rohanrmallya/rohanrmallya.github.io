about-author: 'I should probably write about who I am here. But I am not going to. 
              Because, #myblog. This blog is a very informal translation of all the formal thoughts that I have. 
              Most of the thoughts I have are jokes. But, some are interesting. Here they are. 
              If the thoughts mentioned here are funny, do let me know. ;) 
              Also, might use this blog as a human logger to log everything I have learned (whenever I do learn it) because 
              again #myblog.'
